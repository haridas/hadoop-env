== Spark on Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a linux container manager, the ideas is similar to how yarn manages the 
jvm containers in hadoop environment. Kubernetes can be used to deploy very hetrogenious
workloads, and it can meet a requirements of an entire business. eg; Deploy applications
, dev/stage environments, offline or batch processing services etc. As the hadoop
environment is specific to bigdata processing, here we can use existing kubernetes
cluster to do the things that we done on hadoop cluster or spark cluster.

This tutorial covers how we can quickly setup a kubernetes cluster and deploy a
spark cluster on it, so that then we can play on spark. The kubernetes act as one
of the spark's cluster manager, there is no change in other aspects of how spark
does it's functionalities.


== Setup spark on kubernetes

Kubernet can be deploy in multi-node or single node environment similar to
hadoop cluster. Here we try the kubernetes setup on a VM.


We will be using `minikube` tool to setup kubernetes cluster. Minikube provide an easy
way to setup kubernetes cluster on a VM for testing and experiment purpose.

=== Gnu/Linux Environment:-

- Install virtualbox
- Follow this link to install minikube https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/#install-minikube
- Install kubectl - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-using-native-package-management

Start the minikube to launch the kubernetes cluster.
```bash
minikube start --cpus 3 --memory 6000
```

=== Mac environment:- 

```bash
brew cask install minikube
brew install docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
minikube start --vm-driver hyperkit --cpus 3 --memory 6000
```

`kubectl` command available in mac if you already have the docker installed.

=== Test kubernetes cluster is up

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```
Copy the master URL, we need it bellow to submit spark jobs.


```bash

kubectl create namespace spark1
kubectl create serviceaccount jumppod -n spark1
kubectl create rolebinding jumppod-rb --clusterrole=admin --serviceaccount=spark1:jumppod -n spark1
kubectl run jump-1 -ti --rm=true -n spark1 --image=brainlounge/jumppod:ubuntu-18.04 --serviceaccount='jumppod'

```

=== Ensure you have JDK 1.8 installed in your laptop

=== Prepare spark container images for kubernetes cluster

Kubernetes is a container manager or orchestrator, we need to package the spark in
docker image form to deploy them on kubernetes cluster.
`spark-submit` command support the spark job submission into kubernetes cluster
by just changing the `--master url`


NOTE: Run this after the kubernetes cluster is up.
```bash
# Download a copy of the spark binary into your laptop and build the docker
# image from it.
wget http://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/spark/spark-2.4.0/spark-2.4.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
cd spark-2.4.0-bin-hadoop2.7
./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -m -t 2.4.0 build
```

=== Start a spark client on kubernetes cluster manager

```bash

# Get the kubernetes master url, will be in this form 'https://<host:port>'.
minikube cluster-info

cd spark-2.4.0-bin-hadoop2.7
./bin/spark-shell --master k8s://https://<host:port> --name spark-kube-cli --deploy-mode client \
    --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=spark:2.4.0

```
Now we can try with all the spark command features available, only change here
is the `--master` param and extra `--conf` with image name for the spark.


== Why spark on kubernetes

1. Kubernetes can work with wide variety of application cluster, your entire application
stack it can host.
2. Easy to deploy and manager different types of applications and its different stages.
3. If you have a kubernetes cluster in your infrastructure, this is the best option
  available to run a spark.
